# Gaussian Filtering


## Project Description

This Python script performs Gaussian filtering on a grayscale image using OpenCV and NumPy libraries. Gaussian filtering is a common image processing technique used to blur images and reduce noise. The script reads an input image in TIFF format, applies a Gaussian filter to it, and saves the processed image in the same format.
